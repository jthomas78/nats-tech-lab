# nats-tech-lab — Implementation Plan

## Purpose

A lab application for evaluating NATS.io patterns in the context of a V3 greenfield logistics platform. Each demo is self-contained: the user picks a pattern from the lab shell, reads an intro, launches the demo (Docker), and shuts it down when done.

The core architectural question being investigated: **what is the correct responsibility split between JetStream (event backbone), NATS KV (fast lookup/watch/cache), Postgres (transactional source of truth), and CQRS projections?**

---

## Project Structure

```
nats-tech-lab/
  lab-shell/              # Vue 3 + PrimeVue + Pinia frontend (demo menu + intro pages)
  demos/
    01-dictionary/        # First demo: Dictionary POC
      backend/            # Go service (hexagonal layout, borrowed from Fizmath Plaza)
      frontend/           # Vue 3 demo UI (isolated, own docker-compose)
      docker-compose.yml  # Spins up: Postgres + NATS + backend + frontend
      README.md           # Intro text shown in lab shell
```

---

## Lab Shell (Phase 1)

**Stack:** Vue 3 + PrimeVue v4 + Pinia

**Responsibility:** A simple menu listing available demos. Each entry shows:

- Demo title and one-line description
- A "Launch" button that opens the demo UI in a new tab (or iframe — decided: new tab for Phase 1)
- A brief intro page explaining the pattern being demonstrated

**Key design note:** Pinia stores are intentionally used as a frontend analogue to server-side materialized views. Both are projected read models derived from an event source — just at different layers (KV/Postgres on server, Pinia in browser). This parallel should be explicit in the UI and docs.

**Phase 1 scope:** Static menu + intro pages only. No live status. Microfrontend integration is out of scope.

---

## UI Styling — UniFi Aesthetic

**Library:** PrimeVue v4 (Vue 3-only). Start from the **Aura preset** (darkest built-in) and override `--p-*` CSS tokens.

**Design target:** UniFi Network Application — dark, data-dense, angular. Not a pixel-perfect clone; enough fidelity to evoke the aesthetic.

**Verified starting tokens** (community reverse-engineered from proxmorph; text colors survived adversarial verification, background/accent did not — extract those from a live UniFi instance via devtools):

```css
/* Text — medium confidence (proxmorph, 2-1 vote) */
--p-text-color:          #DEE0E3;   /* primary text */
--p-text-muted-color:    #B7BCC2;   /* secondary / label */
--p-text-disabled-color: #737C87;   /* disabled / hint */

/* Background + accent — extract from live UniFi instance */
/* Open UniFi Network App → devtools → inspect :root for --ubnt-* or --unifi-* */
```

**Dark mode:** PrimeVue v4 activates dark mode via `document.documentElement.classList.toggle('p-dark')` — the same class-toggle pattern UniFi uses (`.ubnt-mod-dark` on `body`). Default to dark.

**Data tables:** Use `<DataTable size="small">` — supports frozen columns, row grouping, multi-level headers, and lazy loading, matching the density of UniFi's grid views.

**Shared theme file:** Both `lab-shell/` and `demos/01-dictionary/frontend/` import the same custom Aura-based preset so styling stays in sync across frontends.

## Demo 01 — Dictionary POC

### Problem

Dictionary/reference data (UI dropdowns, enums, locale config, tenant config, CQRS read-model lookup data) needs to be:

- Derived from an event source
- Returned based on application context (tenant, region, locale)
- Available with low latency

### Two Shapes to Compare Side-by-Side

#### Shape A — NATS KV as the Read Model

- Event handlers project directly from JetStream into KV
- Dictionary reads go straight to KV
- No Postgres-backed read table involved
- KV key format: `{context}:{entityType}:{id}` (e.g. `en-GB:currency:GBP`)

#### Shape B — NATS KV as Cache in Front of Postgres

- Canonical CQRS projection lives in Postgres (the write-side event sourcing table)
- KV is a derived, low-latency cache/distribution layer
- Eager write-through: the JetStream handler upserts Postgres then immediately overwrites the KV entry with the persisted value
- Cache miss falls through to Postgres

### Backend (Go)

Borrow from Fizmath Plaza: jstream wrapper, waiter, monolith composition, hexagonal layout, Docker Compose setup. **Do not retrofit Fizmath — start fresh.**

**Key differences from Fizmath Plaza:**

- Stream retention: `LimitsPolicy` (not `InterestPolicy`) — required for event replay
- Add NATS KV store usage (Fizmath has none)
- Context-aware key design (tenant/region/locale in key prefix)
- No gRPC-Gateway needed for this demo — plain HTTP REST is fine

**Domain structure:**

```
demos/01-dictionary/backend/
  cmd/main.go               # bootstraps monolith, calls Startup on each module
  internal/monolith/        # Monolith + Module interfaces (ported from Fizmath)
  internal/jstream/         # JetStream wrapper with LimitsPolicy
  internal/kvstore/         # NATS KV wrapper
  dictionary/
    composition.go
    internal/
      domain/               # DictionaryEntry entity, events, repo interface
      application/
        commands/           # CreateEntry, UpdateEntry
        queries/            # GetEntry (Shape A: from KV, Shape B: from KV→Postgres)
      postgres/             # repo implementation (Shape B only)
      eventhandler/         # JetStream consumer → projects into KV (both shapes)
      rest/                 # HTTP handlers
```

### Stream Design

```
Stream name:    DICTIONARY
Subjects:       DICTIONARY.entry.created
                DICTIONARY.entry.updated
Retention:      LimitsPolicy (enables replay)
Storage:        File
```

### KV Bucket Design

```
Bucket names:   dict-a-{context}  (Shape A read model)
                dict-b-{context}  (Shape B cache)
Key format:     {entityType}.{id}
Value:          JSON-encoded DictionaryEntry
```

> **Implementation finding:** the original `{entityType}:{id}` key format is
> invalid — NATS KV keys only allow `[-/_=.a-zA-Z0-9]`, so `.` is used as the
> separator. Buckets were also split per shape (`dict-a-*` / `dict-b-*`) so
> the two projections stay independent for the side-by-side comparison.

### Frontend (Demo UI)

Isolated Vue 3 app inside `demos/01-dictionary/frontend/`. Own docker-compose service.

Two panels side by side:

- **Shape A panel** — reads from KV directly; shows key, value, KV sequence
- **Shape B panel** — reads from KV cache with Postgres fallback; shows cache hit/miss

A form to create/update a dictionary entry fires a command to the backend, which publishes an event. Both panels update reactively (KV watch → SSE or WebSocket → frontend).

---

## Docker Compose Strategy

Each demo has its own `docker-compose.yml`. Lab shell has its own. They do not share networks.

```yaml
# demos/01-dictionary/docker-compose.yml services:
  nats:       nats:latest with JetStream enabled
  postgres:   postgres:16
  backend:    built from ./backend
  frontend:   built from ./frontend
```

Tear-down is `docker compose down` inside the demo directory.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding

- [x] Initialise Go module in `demos/01-dictionary/backend/`
- [x] Port `internal/monolith` interfaces from Fizmath Plaza (written fresh: `Monolith` + `Module`)
- [x] Write `internal/jstream/stream.go` with `LimitsPolicy`
- [x] Write `internal/kvstore/kv.go` wrapper
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` for demo 01 (NATS + Postgres only first)

### Phase 1 — Shape A (KV-only read model)

- [x] `dictionary/internal/domain/` — DictionaryEntry, events
- [x] `dictionary/internal/application/commands/` — CreateEntry, UpdateEntry
- [x] `dictionary/internal/eventhandler/` — consumes JetStream, writes to KV
- [x] `dictionary/internal/application/queries/` — GetEntry reads from KV
- [x] `dictionary/internal/rest/` — HTTP handlers
- [x] Backend wired in `composition.go` + `cmd/main.go`
- [x] Smoke test: create entry → event → KV → GET returns value
      (`dictionary/integration_test.go` against an embedded in-process NATS server)

### Phase 2 — Shape B (KV cache + Postgres projection)

- [x] `dictionary/internal/postgres/` — repo implementation, migration
- [x] Event handler variant: projects to Postgres AND writes KV
- [x] Query variant: KV hit → return; KV miss → Postgres → write KV → return
- [x] Demonstrate cache miss path explicitly in demo UI
      (`DELETE /api/shape-b/cache/...` + per-row Evict button, hit/miss badge)

### Phase 3 — Demo Frontend

- [x] Scaffold Vue 3 app in `demos/01-dictionary/frontend/`
- [x] Install PrimeVue v4, create shared UniFi theme preset (Aura base + `--p-*` token overrides)
      (`shared/unifi-theme/` at repo root; dependency-free factory so both apps import the same file)
- [x] Side-by-side Shape A / Shape B panels (use `<DataTable size="small">`)
- [x] Create/Update entry form
- [x] KV watch → SSE → reactive panel updates (`GET /api/watch/{context}` → EventSource → Pinia)
- [x] Default to dark mode (`p-dark` class on `documentElement`)
- [x] Add frontend container to docker-compose.yml

### Phase 4 — Lab Shell

- [x] Scaffold Vue 3 + PrimeVue v4 in `lab-shell/`
- [x] Import shared UniFi theme preset (same file as demo frontend)
- [x] Demo menu page
- [x] Demo 01 intro page (content from README.md, imported `?raw` + rendered with marked)
- [x] "Launch demo" → new tab

### Phase 5 — Data-Flow Vertical Layout Redesign

Restructure the demo frontend so the screen layout maps top-to-bottom to the data pipeline:
Command → JetStream → KV projections → KV watch stream.

- [x] Backend: add `GET /api/jetstream/watch` SSE endpoint (ephemeral ordered consumer on `DICTIONARY.*`, `DeliverNew` policy)
  - `rest/handlers.go` — add `js jetstream.JetStream` field + param + new route
  - `rest/sse.go` — add `jsEvent` struct + `watchJetStream` handler
  - `composition.go` — pass `mono.JS()` to `rest.NewHandlers`
- [x] Frontend: reorder `App.vue` sections (EntryForm → JetStreamPanel → panels → EventLog)
- [x] New `components/JetStreamPanel.vue` — live NATS subject/seq/payload feed via `/api/jetstream/watch`
- [x] `components/ShapePanel.vue` — Shape B: add Postgres projection sub-table below KV cache rows
- [x] `src/api.js` — add `listShapeB(context)` → `GET /api/shape-b/entries/{context}`
- [x] `components/EventLog.vue` — add filter bar: Shape (All/A/B), Op (All/PUT/DEL/PURGE), Key text search

### Phase 6 — Shipping Domain + Shape C (Event Sourcing Reconstruction)

**Domain reference:** Martin Fowler — Event Sourcing: https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html
(Ship → Port → Cargo as the domain subject)

**Structural reference:** Petrosyan — CQRS and Event Sourcing in Go: https://medium.com/@stani.petrosyan/how-to-implement-cqrs-and-event-sourcing-pattern-in-go-fd47dc0afd80
(CommandBus → Handler → hydrate aggregate → validate → publish as the Go implementation pattern)

#### Motivation

Shape A and Shape B demonstrate event-driven CQRS: events flow into persistent projections (KV, Postgres) and reads go to those projections. What they don't show is the defining property of pure event sourcing: **the ability to reconstruct current state by replaying the event log alone, with no persistent read model**.

Shape C closes that gap. It also introduces a domain with real business rules, where the command handler must know current aggregate state before accepting a command — a pattern not present in the generic dictionary domain.

#### Domain change — replace dictionary with shipping

The generic create/update entry form is replaced with a shipping operations panel. The infrastructure (JetStream, KV, Postgres, SSE) is unchanged; only the domain and UI fields change.

| Concept | Example values |
|---|---|
| Ship | "Orient Express", "Pacific Star" |
| Port | "Hamburg", "Rotterdam", "Singapore" |
| Cargo | "Electronics — 42 units", "Textiles — 180 units" |
| Events | `ship.arrived`, `ship.departed`, `cargo.loaded`, `cargo.unloaded` |

#### Domain rules (enforced before publishing to JetStream)

- A ship **cannot depart** a port it has not arrived at
- A ship **cannot arrive** at a port it is already at
- A ship **cannot load or unload cargo** unless it is currently docked in port

#### Architecture — ShipAggregate (Petrosyan's CommandBus pattern adapted for NATS JetStream)

The key structural difference from the Medium article: the event store is **NATS JetStream**, not an in-memory store. Aggregate hydration replays events from JetStream filtered by ship ID. Otherwise the pattern is identical.

The flow for each command:

1. Command arrives via REST (e.g. `DepartPort{shipID: "orient-express", port: "Hamburg"}`)
2. Command handler creates a blank `ShipAggregate` for that ship ID
3. Handler calls `aggregate.Hydrate(ctx, js, shipID)` — replays all events for that ship from JetStream to rebuild current state (current port, cargo manifest)
4. Handler calls `aggregate.Depart(port)` — validates the rule, returns the new event or an error
5. On success, handler publishes the event to JetStream

The same `ShipAggregate.Hydrate` + `Apply` logic is used by both the command handlers (write side) and Shape C's fleet query (read side). This is the key insight: **one aggregate, two uses**.

#### Shape C — pure event sourcing read model

- No KV bucket, no Postgres table
- `GET /api/shape-c/fleet` replays the full stream from `seq=1`, builds a `ShipAggregate` per ship by calling `Apply` for each event, returns the current fleet state
- Sits alongside Shape A and Shape B in the panels grid
- Makes the reconstruction property visible: clear the KV / Postgres data, hit the endpoint — Shape C still returns correct state from the event log alone

#### Frontend changes

- **Shipping Operations panel** replaces `EntryForm.vue` — operation selector (Arrive / Depart / Load / Unload) with contextual fields per operation; domain rule violations shown as inline error messages (not just toasts)
- **Shape C panel** added to the panels grid alongside A and B — fleet table: ship, current port, cargo manifest
- JetStream panel Stream tab now shows the full shipping event history

#### Files to add / modify

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `backend/dictionary/internal/domain/ship.go` | `ShipAggregate`: state (shipID, currentPort, cargo list), `Hydrate(ctx, js, shipID)`, `Apply(event)`, command methods `Arrive / Depart / LoadCargo / UnloadCargo` each returning a domain event or error |
| `backend/dictionary/internal/domain/events.go` | Replace entry events with: `ShipArrived`, `ShipDeparted`, `CargoLoaded`, `CargoUnloaded`; update `StreamSubjects()` |
| `backend/dictionary/internal/application/commands/ship.go` | Four command handlers (one per operation); each hydrates the aggregate, calls the domain method, publishes on success |
| `backend/dictionary/internal/application/queries/shape_c.go` | `ReconstructFleet(ctx, js)`: iterates all stream messages, routes each to the correct `ShipAggregate` via `Apply`, returns `[]ShipState` |
| `backend/dictionary/internal/rest/handlers.go` | Replace entry routes with ship command routes; add `GET /api/shape-c/fleet`; remove Shape A/B list routes that depended on entry domain (KV watch still works — shape A/B projectors just project ship events now) |
| `backend/dictionary/internal/eventhandler/handler.go` | Update to consume new event subjects |
| `backend/dictionary/composition.go` | Wire new command handlers and Shape C query |
| `frontend/src/components/ShippingForm.vue` | New — replaces `EntryForm.vue`; operation selector + contextual fields + inline validation errors |
| `frontend/src/components/ShapeCPanel.vue` | New — fleet state table (ship, current port, cargo) polled from `GET /api/shape-c/fleet` |
| `frontend/src/App.vue` | Replace `<EntryForm />` with `<ShippingForm />`; add `<ShapeCPanel />` to panels grid |
| `frontend/src/api.js` | Replace entry functions with ship command functions; add `getFleet()` |
| `frontend/src/stores/dictionary.js` | Update KV watch event shape to match ship projection keys |

#### Checklist

- [x] Backend: `domain/ship.go` — `ShipAggregate` with `Hydrate`, `Apply`, and four rule-enforcing command methods
- [x] Backend: `domain/events.go` — replace entry event types with four shipping events; update `StreamSubjects()`
- [x] Backend: `application/commands/commands.go` — four handlers, each hydrates aggregate before publishing
- [x] Backend: `application/queries/shape_c.go` — `ReconstructFleet` via full stream replay
- [x] Backend: `rest/handlers.go` — new ship command routes + `GET /api/shape-c/fleet`
- [x] Backend: `eventhandler/handler.go` — consume updated subjects
- [x] Backend: `composition.go` — wire new handlers and Shape C query
- [x] Backend: `go build ./...` + `go test ./...` green
- [x] Frontend: `ShippingForm.vue` — operation selector, contextual fields, inline error display
- [x] Frontend: `ShapeCPanel.vue` — fleet table, reconstructed on demand from `/api/shape-c/fleet`
- [x] Frontend: `App.vue` — swap form, add Shape C panel
- [x] Frontend: `api.js` — ship commands + `getFleet`
- [x] Frontend: `npm run build` green
- [x] Frontend: `stores/dictionary.js` — track `seenPorts` (unique, sorted); updated in `applyWatchEvent` from `event.value.currentPort` on every PUT event
- [x] Frontend: `ShippingForm.vue` — `portOptions` computed merges static `BASE_PORTS` with `store.seenPorts`; port dropdown auto-populates with any port seen in the event source that is not already in the static list

### Phase 7 — Swagger / OpenAPI + Ginkgo Test Runner

Add self-documenting API support using `swaggo/swag` so the backend routes are explorable without reading source code. Also establishes Ginkgo as the canonical test runner to support the red→green→refactor cycle for all subsequent phases.

**Swagger approach:** annotate existing handlers with `swaggo` doc comments; `swag init` generates an OpenAPI 2.0 spec; serve Swagger UI at `/swagger/` via `swaggo/http-swagger`.

**Ginkgo approach:** `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2` with Gomega matchers. A custom `ReportAfterSuite` in `dictionary/suite_test.go` prints a spec tree grouping results under their `Describe` / `Context` nodes, mirroring the `BUSINESS_RULES.md` structure. For each subsequent phase: write specs first (one `Context` per rule, one `It` per assertion), run `ginkgo ./...` to confirm red, implement, confirm green.

#### Checklist

- [x] Backend: `go get github.com/swaggo/swag` + `go get github.com/swaggo/http-swagger`
- [x] Backend: annotate all existing handlers in `rest/handlers.go` and `rest/sse.go` with `swaggo` comments (summary, params, responses)
- [x] Backend: run `swag init` from `backend/` to generate `docs/` package
- [x] Backend: mount Swagger UI at `/swagger/` in `handlers.go` via `httpSwagger.Handler`
- [x] Backend: add `swag init` step to Dockerfile so the spec stays in sync with handlers
- [x] Backend: `go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2` + `go get github.com/onsi/gomega`; install `ginkgo` CLI
- [x] Backend: rewrite `dictionary/integration_test.go` in Ginkgo DSL (`Describe` / `Context` / `It` / `By` / `BeforeEach`)
- [x] Backend: `dictionary/suite_test.go` — bootstrap + `ReportAfterSuite` tree reporter
- [ ] Verify Swagger UI accessible at `http://localhost:18080/swagger/`

### Phase 8 — KV Metadata Projections (Superset Data Types)

#### Background

The shipping domain exposes a broader architectural question: beyond ship state (Shape A/B/C), what other *derived lookup sets* should be maintained as KV projections rather than reconstructed from the event log or accumulated client-side?

The working model is a **superset of KV data types**, of which `meta.*` is the first:

| Namespace | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ship.*` | Per-ship current state (Shape A/B projections) | implemented |
| `meta.*` | Cross-cutting derived lookup sets (ports seen, cargo types seen, etc.) | **this phase** |
| `locale.*` | Localisation config per context | out of scope — future phase |
| `tenant.*` | Tenant-specific configuration | out of scope — future phase |

The `locale.*` and `tenant.*` namespaces are noted here for continuity but are not in scope for this phase of the POC.

#### Goal for this phase — `meta.known-ports`

Move port-list accumulation from the frontend (`seenPorts` in Pinia) to a backend KV projection, so the full set of ports ever seen survives app reload without event replay.

**Pattern:** the `eventhandler` projector already processes every ship event. Extend it to also maintain a `meta.known-ports` KV key (JSON array, sorted) in a dedicated `dict-meta-{context}` bucket. The frontend seeds `seenPorts` from this key on SSE connect rather than accumulating from scratch.

#### Checklist

- [ ] Backend: create `dict-meta-{context}` KV bucket in `kvstore` / `composition.go`
- [ ] Backend: `eventhandler/handler.go` — on each `ShipArrived` / `ShipDeparted` event, read `meta.known-ports`, merge new port, write back (idempotent upsert)
- [ ] Backend: `rest/handlers.go` — add `GET /api/meta/{context}/known-ports` returning the KV value
- [ ] Frontend: `api.js` — add `getKnownPorts(context)`
- [ ] Frontend: `stores/dictionary.js` — on `connect()`, fetch `getKnownPorts` and seed `seenPorts` before the SSE stream opens; continue merging live events as before
- [ ] Frontend: `ShippingForm.vue` — no change needed; `portOptions` already reads from `store.seenPorts`
- [ ] Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` — rename the existing `Port Dropdown Selection Data` section to `Metadata Projections (meta.*)` and expand it to cover: the full superset of KV namespaces (`ship.*`, `meta.*`, `locale.*`, `tenant.*`), the `dict-meta-{context}` bucket design, how the projector maintains `meta.known-ports` incrementally, and how the frontend seeds from the REST endpoint on connect before switching to live SSE updates

### Verification status (2026-07-07)

Docker is not installed on the dev machine, so the compose stack has not been
run end to end. What IS verified: `go build`, `go vet`, and `go test` all pass
(integration tests run command → event → projector → KV → query against a
real embedded JetStream, plus Shape B cache hit/miss/backfill); both frontends
build with `npm run build`. Postgres repo + Dockerfiles + nginx SSE proxy are
code-reviewed but need `docker compose up --build` for a live run.

---

## Working Assumptions

- Postgres remains the source of truth for governed dictionary data (Shape B assumption)
- NATS KV is appropriate for low-latency lookup and watch-based invalidation
- Context key (tenant/region/locale) is always present in the KV key — no global/unscoped lookups
- Eventual consistency is acceptable for dictionary reads
- No approval workflow, audit trail, or versioning needed for this POC
- Demo data is seeded via the command API (no seed scripts needed)
